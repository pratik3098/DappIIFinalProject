#### HealthBlocks

#### Description:

The solution for the problem is HeatlhBlocks.
A blockchain based patient focused platform tracking  the patient  during his/her medical journey. Thus helping the  patient to  store and retrieve   all  his/ her medical records in one place.  
HealthBlocks tracks and records the whole patient medical journey on  a private blockchain platform, recording all the events in the process.
It will hash the EMRs and Prescriptions and store it in the Ethereum Wallet, thus making it tamper proof and easy to verify by various entities on and off the platform.
